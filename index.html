    <h3 class="h3">What is CSS ?</h3>

<ol type="1">
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Shee</li><br>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media.</li><br>
    <li><strike class="strike">CSS is not necessary</strike> <span class="span">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> "It can contol the layout of multiple web pages all at once"</li><br>
    <li class="italic">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</li><br>
    </ol><br>


    <h1 class="h">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>

    <ul class="a">
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>

        <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>

        <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however, <span class="p6">in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p1">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p><br>

    <p class="p2">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p><br>

    <p class="p3">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
